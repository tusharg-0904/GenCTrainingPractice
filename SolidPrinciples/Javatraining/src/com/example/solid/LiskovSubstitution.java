/**
 * Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
 * 
 * The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass
 * should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting
 * the correctness of the program. This principle is about ensuring
 * that a derived class can stand in for its base class.
 * 
 * This class demonstrates the Liskov Substitution Principle by providing
 * an example of a base class and a derived class that adheres to this
 * principle.
